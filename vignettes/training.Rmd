## Demo

- Do a training run and view the results


- Make some changes and view a comparison


- Do some additional experimentation (using flags) then run queries against all the runs


- Once I've found the best run copy it out


## IDE Integration

- Addin
- Use of terminal
- Publishing

## Learning More


- [Run Visualization](visualization.html) describes the various options for viewing and comparing runs, including the ability to save and publish run reports. 

- [Training Run Flags](flags.html) covers the use of flags to paramaterize key hyperparameters of your model.

- [Managing Training Runs](managing.html) provides documentation on listing runs (including sorting and filtering by various criteria), exporting run data (e.g. model artifcats), and purging runs no longer of interest.
