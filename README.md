================

Overview
--------

Demo
----

-   Do a training run and view the results

-   Make some changes and view a comparison

-   Do some additional experimentation (using flags) then run queries against all the runs

-   Once I've found the best run copy it out

Learning More
-------------

-   [Run Visualization](visualization.html) describes the various options for viewing and comparing runs, including the ability to save and publish run reports.

-   [Training Run Flags](flags.html) covers the use of flags to paramaterize key hyperparameters of your model.

-   [Managing Training Runs](managing.html) provides documentation on listing runs (including sorting and filtering by various criteria), exporting run data (e.g. model artifcats), and removing runs no longer of interest.
